# CAB302-Group-Assignment
The group assignment repository

Things to note about the assignment: 
 - Commits need to be clear in description of what is being commited
 - Tests in JUnit must be written by opposite partner
 - Each class must have JavaDoc-style comments to describe the overall purpose
 - Methods must also use this commenting (must have params and return values)
  ~ Commenting shortcut is /** + Enter
  ~ JavaDocs must be regenerated every time you change the comments (week 2 lec week 3 tut)
 - Report outline is: Title page (1 page), description of the architecture of the program (use 
   diagram of trees and what not to show this) and discussion of concepts such as polymorphism / abstraction, and 
   a GUI test report that shows the functionality of the application (2-5 pages)
  ~ Program architecture section must talk about every class in high level detail (methods and how they interact with
   other classes)
  ~ Really must use OO design concepts and terms, as well as drawing attention to design patterns (observers) 
  ~ GUI test report must show all the goods and the bads (wrong file upload, sales log greater than intentory etc)
 - PDF of the documentation, the package with the code and a git log demonstrating consistent version control
